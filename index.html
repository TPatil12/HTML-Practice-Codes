        The word Photography literally means 'drawing with light', which derives from the Greek photo, meaning light and
        graph, meaning to draw. Photography is the process of recording an image – a photograph – on lightsensitive film
        or, in the case of digital photography, via a digital electronic or magnetic memory.<br>Photography skills refer
        to the set of skills that you need to capture and produce high-quality photographs. Photography skills include
        the creative skills you need to capture unique photographs but also the technical skills necessary to operate
        camera equipment and edit photos after you've taken them.

                              On being a poet and a photographer
                              Spilled ink.
                              Old film.
                              Crumpled paper.
                              The click of a shutter.
                              Pens dying.
                              Wiping lenses.
                              Flashlights under the covers.
    
                              the soliloquy of the photographer
                              Every year is the same,
                              same people,
                              same places,
                              same time,
                              same faces.
                              They bring me their labeled tickets,
                              the same ugly tan-colored, black-inked tickets.
